Basic Fundamentals of Python
Python is a simple and powerful programming language with an easy-to-understand syntax. Below are the key fundamentals of Python, which every beginner should understand to get started with programming in Python.
. Variables and Data Types
In Python, variables are used to store data. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you donâ€™t need to declare the type of variable explicitly; Python determines it at runtime.

Common Data Types:
int: Integer (whole numbers)
float: Floating-point number (decimal values)
str: String (text)
bool: Boolean (True or False)
list: List (ordered, mutable collection of items)
tuple: Tuple (ordered, immutable collection of items)
dict: Dictionary (key-value pairs)
set: Set (unordered collection of unique items)
python
x = 10            # int
y = 3.14          # float
name = "Alice"    # str
is_active = True  # bool
2. Basic Operators
Python supports various types of operators to perform arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other operations:

Arithmetic Operators:
+ (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), // (floor division), % (modulus), ** (exponentiation)
python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)   # Output: 8
print(x ** y)  # Output: 125 (5 raised to the power of 3)
Comparison Operators:
== (equal), != (not equal), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)
python
a = 5
b = 10
print(a == b)  # False
print(a != b)  # True
print(a > b)   # False
Logical Operators:
and, or, not (used for combining boolean conditions)
python
x = True
y = False
print(x and y)  # False
print(x or y)   # True
